<h1>Depositing money in a bank account</h1>

<p>Our customer's are going to want to deposit money in their bank account and see a corresponding increase in their balance</p>

<p>The system should therefore be able to respond with a customer's current balance at the point in time they request it.</p>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <div>
        <p concordion:execute="setCurrentBalance(#balance)">Dale has an account with a balance of <code concordion:set="#balance">1045</code>.</p>

        <p concordion:execute="#result = checkCurrentBalance(#dateTime)">Dale checks his balance at <code concordion:set="#dateTime">2019-02-03T10:15:30.00Z</code>.</p>

        <p>The system <span concordion:assert-equals="#result.isBalanceEqualTo(#balance)">correctly</span> reports the balance (along with the <span concordion:assert-true="#result.isDateAndTimeEqualTo(#dateTime)">current date and time</span>).
        </p>
